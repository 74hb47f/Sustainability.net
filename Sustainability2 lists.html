<h3 style="color:blue; font-family: Oswald; font-size:30">Facts About Sustainability</h3>
<ol style="color:white ; font-family: Oswald; font-size:24">
<li>In 2016 many world leaders adopted the United Nation’s 17 global goals/Sustainable Development Goals to improve life all around the world and preserve the earth’s resources and fight climate change.</li>
<li> The concept of the circular economy looks beyond societies’ current take-make-dispose model to create a more restorative economy that designs waste, keeps products and materials in use for as long as possible, and regenerates natural systems.</li>
<li>Climate change is defined as “a change of climate that is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity, that alters the composition of the global atmosphere, and that is in addition to natural climate variability over a comparable period.”</li>
<li>China is the world’s top polluter, emitting 10,357 metric tons of carbon dioxide, followed by the United States, India, Russia, and Japan.</li>
<li>Mpumalanga province in South Africa has the highest levels of air pollution in the world, in terms of nitrogen dioxide levels, due to a high concentration of coal power plants.</li>
<li> Human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide need to fall 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and reach net zero around 2050 to limit climate change catastrophe.</li>
<li>Energy is the dominant contributor to climate change, accounting for around 60% of total global greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
<li>If people worldwide switched to energy-efficient light bulbs, the world would save 105 billion euros annually.</li>
<li>Lighting accounts for 15% of global electricity use. Switching to LEDs will use 90% less energy and last far longer than the use of incandescent lights.</li>
<li>70% of the world is covered by water, yet only 2.5% of it is fresh and only 1% of it is easily accessible for human use.</li>
<li>Plastics take thousands of years to decompose</li>
</ol>
<h3 style=" color: blue; font-family: Oswald; font-size:36"> Short-term impacts of pollution on the environment</h3>
<ul font align="left" style=" color: white ; font-size:24">
<li>Pollution can directly contaminate the surface of bodies of water and soil</li>
<li>Polution can aggravate lung disease</li>
<li>Air polution can trigger asthma attacks</li>
<li>Pollution can increase the levels of carbon dioxide - the ozone layer will be destroyed</li>
<li>Pollution can kill and endanger wildlife</li>
<li>
</ul>
<h3 style=" color: blue; font-family: Oswald; font-size:36"> Long-term impacts of pollution on the environment</h3>
<ul font align="left" style=" color: white ;font-family: Oswald; font-size:24">
<li>Pollution can slowly let the rays of the sun enter the earth</li>`
<li>Pollution can make soil acidic so it may not be used for crops for a long time</li>
<li>Pollution slowly litters our beaches and oceans where animal live - and the plastics can kill them</li>
<li>Microplastics are now everywhere poisoning all living beings</li>
</ul>
<h3 style=" color: Blue; font-family: Oswald; font-size:36">Types of sustainability:</h3>
<ul font align="left" style=" color: white ; font-family: Oswald; font-size:24">
<li>Human
<li>social development
<li>economical development
<li>And environmental.<br><br>
</ul>
<h3 style=" color: Blue; font-family: Oswald; font-size:36">How can we help sustainability at home:</h3>
<ul font align="left" style=" color: white ; font-family: Oswald; font-size:24">
<li>Turn off lights when not using them
<li>Lower your thermostat in winter, raise it in the summer.
<li>Set the refrigerator between 38Â°F and 42Â°F, the freezer between OÂ°F and 5Â°F.
<li>Take shorter showers, shut off water during brushing, add a brick to your toilet tank.
<li>Avoid pesticide and fertilizer use
<li>Avoid watering the lawn too often
<li>Compost plant material
<li>Use natural landscaping and native plants
<li>Reduce, Reuse and Recycle in that order
<li>Consider buying in bulk sizes and refillable containers
<li>Turn off you engine when idling more than 10 seconds
<li>Keep your tires inflated to the correct pressure
<li>Environmental sustainability facts show that enough plastic is thrown away each year to circle the earth four times.
